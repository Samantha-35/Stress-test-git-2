#Introduction
##Markdown is a opensource markup language created by John Grubcer. It is used to write plain text and readable with special syntax,finally converted to HTML. It is simple and fun to learn this. Markdown helps users to write plain text and convert to multiple formats. >>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax.

<script type="text/javascript">
    alert("Hello!");
</script>

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
